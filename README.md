# Mimics Handwriting Generation
The handwriting generation pipeline begins with loading and preprocessing the EMNIST dataset, followed by training a cGAN with a Generator and Discriminator. User handwriting samples are collected, preprocessed, and used to fine-tune the cGAN, adapting it to the user’s style. Input text is tokenized, normalized, and combined with the user’s handwriting style to generate personalized handwritten text images. The final output is rendered on virtual A4 paper. Continuous improvement is achieved by periodically retraining the model with new user data, ensuring the generated handwriting remains accurate and personalized.
